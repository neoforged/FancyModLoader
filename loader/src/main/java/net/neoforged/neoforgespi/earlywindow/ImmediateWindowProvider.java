/**
 * This is for allowing the plugging in of alternative early display implementations.

 *
 * There are a few key things to keep in mind if following through on implementation. You cannot access the game state as it
 * literally DOES NOT EXIST at the time this object is constructed. You have to be very careful about managing the handoff
 * to mojang, be sure that if you're trying to tick your window in a background thread (a nice idea!) that you properly
 * transition to the main thread before handoff is complete. Do note that in general, you should construct your GL objects
 * on the MAIN thread before starting your ticker, to ensure MacOS compatibility.
 *
 * No doubt many more things can be said here.
